# Rekkids


This is Rekkids, a vinyl record cataloguing application. 

I decided to make this app as I am an avid collector of
records and have no real solid way of cataloguing them my own way.

Objective is to have a list of what records you have, when you acquired them, 
and what about them makes them so special.
